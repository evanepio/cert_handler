# Cert Handler

This is a simple node script to get the certificate and private key from DNSimple API and place them where they need to be.

You need the following environment variables:

* `DNSIMPLE_API_TOKEN`
* `DNSIMPLE_ACCOUNT_ID`
* `DOMAIN_NAME`

This just prints the cert to console right now. Super safe, if you like your passwords to be announced over the PA system.
